# PDAC_model


Lay Summary: 
•	The chemotherapy regimens, FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (G-nP) are recommended to be delivered prior to tumor resection surgery for patients with borderline resectable/locally advanced pancreatic cancer, but the outcomes from these two regimens have not been directly compared to each other in a clinical trial.
•	A decision-analytic mathematical model was created to compare the health outcomes and total costs of neoadjuvant FOFLIRINOX and neoadjuvant G-nP with the primary endpoint being incremental cost-effective.
•	FOLFIRINOX was the cost-effective strategy compared to G-nP.
•	Additional studies are necessary to determine confirm these findings.

Precis: The purpose of this mathematical model is to compare the treatment outcomes and costs of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX was the cost-effective strategy compared to neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel despite the latter having a higher cost of care due to the increased treatment-related adverse events cost.
